            <p>Chinua Achebe was a Nigerian
            novelist, poet, and critic who is regarded as the dominant figure in modern African literature. His first novel and
            magnum opus Things Fall Apart (1958), occupies a pivotal place in African literature, and remains the most widely
            studied, taught and read African novel.</p>
            <p>His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories,
            proverbs, and oratory. Along with Things Fall Apart, his No Longer at Ease (1960) and Arrow of God (1964) complete the
            so called "African Trilogy"; his later novels include A Man of the People (1966) and Anthills of the Savannah (1987).
            In addition to his seminal novels, his oeuvre includes a large number of short stories, poetry, essay collections and
            children's books.</p>
